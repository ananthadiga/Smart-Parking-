# Smart-Parking-
Smark Parking is a IOT project, the project Helps us to automate parking. 
With the advancement in technology cities have become smarter. Take an example of smart traffic management or smart water treatment have changed the way cities work. One of the aspects where technology can be used to make cities smart is parking. Parking facilities has become a huge problem nowadays.This problem is due to unplanned housings that has increased the number of vehicles. This leads to creating mess everywhere and also increases traffic. This kind of problem mainly arises in street(open) parking. There is a need of an application that could let the people know where to park their vehicles before hand to avoid the traffic congestion An estimation of 3 million vehicles on roads in major cities across globe.
Objective
Since there is an increasing number of vehicles, there has to be sufficient number of parking spaces made available.
In this project, entire focus is put upon parking spaces in closed areas(shopping malls).
This project is designed in such a way that energy, time and fuel are conserved.
We built a model which is a replica of a mall we used IOT & Embedded System in the project to solve parking issue. We automated 90% of the work. We stored data in the cloud & used php as our script language.
Working of the project in General

When a car enters into the parking lot, the LCD screen displays the information as to where the car should go and park.
This information to the LCD is given by sensors that are placed, in each parking lot.
When there is no car parked, the LED glows green, and no light glows when the slot is occupied.
When the slot is full, the sensors send information to the display and the database, where the data is stored in the database.
This data is displayed on the web screen and will be saved in it until we rerun the program.
